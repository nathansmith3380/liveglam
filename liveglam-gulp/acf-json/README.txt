ACF-THEME-JSON GENERAL INFORMATION

INTRODUCTION
----------------------------------------------------------------

The folder contains the ACF JSON used to define the ACF groups.

Typically JSON files should only be synced and available for edit in the WP Admin under 'Custom Fields' on the local development server.
JSON files should NOT be synced on staging or production.
This is because if it is synced and edits made then it will update the JSON files on the staging or production server and the file versioning will get off.

Some useful resources when coming to understand how the ACF JSON works:
